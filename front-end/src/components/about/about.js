                  employMe aims to help employers pick the right employees to fill up the missing players in open roles.
                  We want to partner with companies to help employees feel secured about their applications so they know it went to the right hands.
                  Most of all we want to keep encouraging the youth to never stop the hunt until they catch their moment.
                  We want to help employees stay motivated while searching for a home to kick start their careers.
                  Together we can do this because it is possible.
